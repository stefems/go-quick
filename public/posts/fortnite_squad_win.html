						   <p class="c0 c4"><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It&rsquo;s time for strategy session and we&rsquo;re going to talk about Fortnite: Battle Royale. You&rsquo;re probably familiar with it because of its controversy and similarity with PUBG, or for a much better reason, you&rsquo;ve seen videos of white boys getting livid at their squadmates. (Quality entertainment, if you ask me.) Let&rsquo;s not get livid at our teammates. Let&rsquo;s jump out of the Battle Bus and get started. If you just came for the sweet gifs, scroll down! All of the clips were made by me and my squadmates.
</span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.vhenvl2x3p3p"><span class="c3">Gunplay</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Fortnite is a third-person shooting game. In order to win, you&rsquo;re going to have to shoot at people, and more importantly: you&rsquo;ll have to hit them with your bullets. If you&rsquo;re confident with your gunplay, skip to the next section. The takeaways from these first few sections are going to be relevant to nearly all shooting games. Fortnite is a one-life per game. Shooting gets you killed. Don&rsquo;t sleep on your shooting strategies. The meta or strategy of doing well in shooting games boils down to a few crucial ingredients: can I shoot the other players effectively, do I know how to position myself in a fight, and when should I shoot? First things first: effective shooting. This has a lot to do with your aim sensitivity. If you feel like you&rsquo;re struggling to hit other players, adjust your settings. Similarly, if you feel like your looking speed is slowing you down, crank up your sensitivity instead. Fortnite allows for aiming, scoping, and normal look sensitivities, so play around with these settings to get a feel for what fits you the best. It&rsquo;s also important that you choose weapons that feel good to you. We&rsquo;ll talk about weapons later. And, of course, you&rsquo;re going to want to aim for the head. In the heat of battle this can be hard to remember, but if you practice and land headshots it&rsquo;ll save your skin in most engagements. The next important factor in shooting games is your placement. If shooting is your offense, your best defense is your movement. Staying still in Fortnite is never good. Sure, if you have cover you&rsquo;ll want to not move so that your aiming is more accurate, but you should never stand still for longer than a few seconds regardless of how safe you think you are. Snipers are deadly; even more deadly when you don&rsquo;t move. Moving when engaged without cover is called strafing. You move your character back and forth or erratically to make your character harder to hit. Jumping is particularly effective in Fortnite at close ranges. Jumping like a madman can help you close a distance to get within optimal shotgun range. If you&rsquo;re in cover, you should try to pop out from different angles and different locations. Keeping your enemy guessing with your movement can throw off their aim and keep you alive. The third crucial concept is about timing and the rules of engagement. Should I initiate a gun fight? is an extremely important question in Fortnite, and while we&rsquo;ll talk more about that later, in general you&rsquo;re never going to want to initiate a fight you can&rsquo;t win. Pretty obvious, right? Fights you can&rsquo;t win look like these: you don&rsquo;t have a good shot on the target because of their distance from you, you don&rsquo;t have cover to shield you when they return fire, or they have more teammates with them than you do. Don&rsquo;t engage the enemy unless you know you can kill them. Let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;re already fighting the enemy and you&rsquo;re popping in and out of cover. When do I pop out? How often do I pop out? People are good at detecting patterns. Don&rsquo;t pop out of cover at regular intervals. Pop in and out of cover at irregular intervals. Hide for 2 seconds, and then 8 seconds, and then 1 second and then 2 seconds, and don&rsquo;t be predictable. Another thing is aggression. Being aggressive is sometimes the best defense. You&rsquo;ve heard the quote: offense is the best defense, but what the heck does that mean and how does that make sense? In Fortnite, it often looks like this: you&rsquo;re pinned down and have enemies advancing on your position. You&rsquo;re unlikely to win if you stay where you are and attempt to re-enact the Alamo. (Spoiler: they didn&rsquo;t win.) Your enemies are smart. They&rsquo;re charging you because they know they&rsquo;ll out-number and over-power you if you stay on the defensive. This is exactly when you go on the offensive. You leave the base to get the flank on them. You leave the base and fight your way to the nearest cover and then fight them while they&rsquo;re in the open and caught off-guard. Another classic example is the good ol&rsquo; double-back. You&rsquo;re retreating to get behind cover. Your cover can be penetrated from one of two sides: the side you entered from, and the other side. When an enemy sees you enter cover, they&rsquo;re not going to want to follow you. They&rsquo;ll shift their advance to enter from the other side. If you anticipate this and time it well, the double-back is when you get behind said cover and then immediately leave from where you came in from and follow the enemy as they try to flank your cover from the opposite side. Engagements are about shooting, positioning, and timing, but they&rsquo;re primarily about mind-games. Use your gun and movement and timing to undermine the opponent&rsquo;s expectations.</span></p>

						 	</p><h1 class="c1" id="h.lz6x79faavc4"><span class="c3">Engaging Enemies</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Fortnite squad gunplay is a big deal. Because Fortnite&rsquo;s time-to-kill (the phrase used to describe how much time on average it takes to kill another player) is pretty long in comparison to games like PUBG or even Call of Duty or Counter Strike, if you have a squad focus fire on a single player the TtK is reduced dramatically (because that one person is getting shot by four people. Pretty obvious.) Use this to your advantage. Use the compass to communicate enemy locations. Use terms to describe how close enemies are (shotgun range, rifle range, sniper range.) Usually the urgency of your voice indicates how close enemies are to you, but being more explicit is extremely helpful. Keep your squad in close proximity when you&rsquo;re not in an engagement. If you&rsquo;re close to each other you can build structures together when caught in a fight and can revive each other more quickly. There are times when you&rsquo;ll want to have your squad split up, but doing so before an engagement will only get your teammates singled-out and killed. If your squad has tenuous cover as enemies advance, you&rsquo;re going to want one or two of your players to leave your base to perform a flank on the advancing enemies. Your whole team can&rsquo;t perform the flank because the enemies will adjust their advance and your squad will be in the same position. Having two players flank while the others maintain fire maintains the pretense that your whole squad is still behind cover, thereby encouraging the enemies to fall into the trap once your two flanking teammates have gotten into position. When your squad is moving, assign flank-awareness to a teammate with the best eyes. Ensure that they&rsquo;re checking the left, right, and rear continuously as your squad moves. Most of your team will have eyes-forward. Don&rsquo;t get tunnel-vision. Always be aware of your surroundings as your squad moves to the next circle. Give the ammo you don&rsquo;t need to your squadmate that needs it. If you don&rsquo;t have a rocket launcher but your teammate does, give up your rockets. Little things like this make a difference.</span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.fil9j3kl3u0d"><span class="c3">Weapons</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c2">What weapons should you use? Let&rsquo;s do a strategic break-down: Fortnite has two SMGs, four rifles, two sniper rifles, two explosive launchers, two shotguns, two types of grenades, three handguns, and a placeable spike trap. SMGs are great for close-range damage if you aim for the head. Shotguns are the obvious choice for any close-range encounter, but the SMG can be optimal when you want to engage an enemy from behind. You&rsquo;ll want to maximize damage while they&rsquo;re taken by surprise, and given that said amount of time is a short window, and given that an SMG&rsquo;s firing rate is extremely fast, you&rsquo;ll be able to get all of that damage dealt while they haven&rsquo;t yet begun strafing or taking cover. As soon as they begin strafing you&rsquo;ll want to switch for the shotgun so that you can more deliberately place your shots. Successive hits with the shotgun provide high-damage but the pump-action or delay between shots isn&rsquo;t optimal during that brief time-period when they&rsquo;re caught off-guard. The semi-auto shotgun is great at dealing damage quickly but the spread is larger than the pump. If you&rsquo;re looking to provide high damage at slightly larger ranges, the pump shotgun is what you want. The pump provides higher damage but more time between shots than the tactical shotgun, and frankly, the pump shotgun is better if you can consistently hit shots. I&rsquo;ve had several games won and lost at the hands of the pump shotgun. </span></p></p>

							<p class="image-subtext">Close call... pump shotgun for the win.</p>
							<p class="c0 c4"><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span>The pistol and silenced pistols (not the revolver) are great SMG replacements because they have great firing rates and can be used effectively at close range and medium range. The magnum is an all-or-nothing weapon that is only optimal at medium distances. You&rsquo;re better off with a rifle, but it&rsquo;ll do in a pinch if you focus on headshots. Getting a green or blue magnum can absolutely destroy enemy shields and health, but if you have an enemy jumping and running all over your face you&rsquo;re gonna have a hard time landing shots. (and you&rsquo;re probably going to die.) Rifles should be your most-used weapons. Aim for the head and don&rsquo;t fire them too quickly and you&rsquo;ll be effective.
							</p></p>
							<video src="../images/ShamefulAromaticGarpike.mp4" loop autoplay></video>
							<p class="image-subtext">Magnum headshots aren't the worst..</p>

							<p class="c0 c4"><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span>The burst rifle is great on non-moving targets but if an enemy is moving perpendicular to your firing, the second and third shots of the burst are likely to miss. The semi-auto rifle is more dependable for this reason and also because it can get more shots off more quickly when the enemy is uncomfortably close. The scoped rifle is great for long-ish engagements but is easily and obviously beaten by a sniper rifle. Sitting with your face in the scope of a scoped rifle can give you tunnel-vision and a false sense of security. Scoped rifles feel nifty and powerful, but you&rsquo;re better off relying on a non-scoped rifle for most engagements. A recent update made the scoped rifles perfectly accurate. Firing the weapon won&rsquo;t reduce the accuracy, but it&rsquo;s worth noting that body shots are pretty lousy with the scoped rifle. Aim for the head. You&rsquo;ve got the accuracy so you&rsquo;ve got to go for it. The SCAR is the rifle you dream of. Fast firing and high damage, never replace a scar for any item in the game. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">About sniper rifles: Fortnite has bullet-drop for all weapons. This means that the bullet will succumb to the effects of gravity as it flies through the air and loses speed. You&rsquo;ll notice this when you&rsquo;re sniping. For this reason, sniping can be pretty difficult to quickly get the hang of.
								</span></p>

								<p class="image-subtext">260 meters?</p>

								<p class="c0 c4"><p class="c0"><span class="c2"></span>
								I&rsquo;ll highly encourage you to use sniper rifles, but your team should be composed mostly of rifleman. A team focusing too much on enemies far away will always fail to dispatch those under its nose. The core difference between the sniper rifles is that one is bolt action and one is semi-automatic. For obvious reasons, one does more damage than the other, but headshots are roughly equivalent. Effectiveness falls primarily upon you. It&rsquo;s easy to lose track of your accuracy when you fire quickly, and this especially holds true for the semi-automatic rifle. It&rsquo;s a good idea to pause after shooting the bolt-action to observe the flight path of the bullet too. Don&rsquo;t go engaging the bolt-action too quickly or you next shot is likely to miss in the same way your first did. Observe how the bullet misses the enemy and go with your gut with the next shot. If you anticipate their movement, lead the bullet, and compensate for bullet drop, you&rsquo;ll be landing headshots in no time. We almost forgot about two of the new weapons! The minigun and crossbow were recently added to the game. The crossbow has infinite ammo and can be fired pretty quickly. The bolts succumb more to gravity than bullets do so you&rsquo;ll need to aim high for enemies at range. The crossbow is also very quiet so your enemy is not likely to know where your shot came from, so long as they didn&rsquo;t see the bolt as it flew through the air, of course. Use the crossbow if you&rsquo;re not under fire and are low on ammo with your other guns. Relying on the crossbow when you&rsquo;re under fire is going to get you killed.

								<p class="image-subtext">Lead your shots!</p>

								
								The minigun is a piece of work. Inaccurate and low-damage (per bullet anyway, close to 15 damage per shot), you&rsquo;re gonna want to use this bad boi when an enemy is behind cover and you&rsquo;ve got squadmates rolling in to finish them off. You can demolish structures lickety split with the minigun, so if you&rsquo;re willing to stand in the open with your melon exposed whilst raining hellfire upon a base, go for it. Lots of squad matches have been won because I&rsquo;ve had a teammate do this while we flanked around or placed precise shots when their cover was destroyed.

									<p class="image-subtext">Easy peazy.</p>

								If you&rsquo;re feeling cocky and try to use the minigun indoors or against someone close by, you might be in for a surprise. The spin-up time and lack of accuracy aren&rsquo;t forgiving when faced against a slippery enemy holding a shotgun. There&rsquo;s also the RPG, grenade launcher, and grenades. Use these for destroying enemy cover, and also for destroying enemies, naturally. The grenade launcher launches grenades that bounce a bit too enthusiastically, but that can be great when you need to weasel an explosive under a base or off a back wall that puts the nade inside their structure. Using a nade launcher on a rapidly-approaching enemy is tricky. The nades are likely to bounce right over or right past them, so you might not want to use them in these situations. The RPG on the other hand is great at dispatching enemies who are behind cover but have a wall exposed on their flank. Get the RPG to explode just around the corner and the splash damage will take them out. Don&rsquo;t look to blow up the wall and the enemy behind it. The wall will take all of the damage and the player will be unscathed. Building a staircase to get altitude is extremely helpful with the RPG. Get above the player and rain down missles and they&rsquo;re going to have a very hard time.</span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.uk2xb5gxkd08"><span class="c3">Landing</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In Fortnite there are named locations and the rural spots dispersed between them. These named locations range from the Prison (well, the Prison isn&rsquo;t actually named but it should be) to the Flush Factory, Tilted Towers, and Anarchy Acres. Where should you land, you ask? Land where you know the land the best. Land where you like the engagements the best. Land where you know there&rsquo;s chests. Landing, no matter the location, boils down to this: can I land next to a weapon before the other guy lands next to that same weapon. If you don&rsquo;t know where the chests are, you&rsquo;re gonna wanna figure that out. Once you have a mental map of the chests in a few towns, keep going back to those towns. Having trouble getting to those chests first? Let&rsquo;s have a conversation about skydiving. You want to maximize speed over time. Your character has greatest vertical speed when pointing straight down in a free-fall. If your LZ is directly under you, you&rsquo;re going to want to free-fall straight down. When you&rsquo;re parachuting, notice that you move faster when going horizontal or lateral to the ground. Going straight down when parachuting is slow. You&rsquo;re going to want to parachute toward your location as it appears in front of you. So, when taken in combination, the fastest way to get to a location is to point straight down, and then glide to your location. Be wary however that you can overestimate your gliding range and fall short of your target. This is when the initial free-fall comes into play. You&rsquo;ll want to tilt yourself to adjust your trajectory to get within said gliding range, or at the farthest extreme, deploy your glider manually for a split second several times as you free fall toward your LZ. </span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.ia0c9my51ye0"><span class="c3">Priorities</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c2">We won&rsquo;t beat around the bush (which isn&rsquo;t worth using, by the way. They&rsquo;re extremely easy to spot and they distort your view), your goal upon landing is to get a gun. Then get shields. Always use the mini-shields before the shield pots. Mini-shields can only be used when your shield is under 50% and they only heal 25% each. Shield pots can give you 50% shields to get you up to 100%. The chug jug heals 100% shields and 100% health, but takes a sweaty 15 seconds to consume. &nbsp;Only begin mining for building materials once you and your squad are convinced that the town is clear of enemies. When you&rsquo;re landing with your squad, land in pairs. Don&rsquo;t spread out. Any one of you can get unlucky and land with no weapons nearby. Being by yourself without a weapon while enemies stomp around nearby is nothing short of terrifying. Having an equipped teammate nearby makes it a lot more comforting, at least.</span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.yorjpndw2n5c"><span class="c3">Circle Movement</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t be stupid about initiating engagements. If you&rsquo;re running away from the storm and spot a team ahead of you, engaging with said enemy will put you between a rock and a hard place: the storm approaching behind you and the enemies blocking your movement away from the storm. That&rsquo;s not ideal. If you&rsquo;re dealing with the storm, deal with the storm before dealing with enemies. You don&rsquo;t ever want the storm nipping at your heels. It might feel great and exhilarating running with it behind you and yes, it&rsquo;s extremely unlikely you&rsquo;ll be flanked when the storm is behind you, but it&rsquo;s much more likely that you&rsquo;ll end up with someone in a great position inside the circle to ruin your nice little jog. That being said, how do you avoid this issue? Preemptive movement, that&rsquo;s how. Always move cautiously toward the center of the circle to reduce your migration period for when the next circle comes. There&rsquo;s a critical distinction between moving vaguely toward the center and being at the center. You generally don&rsquo;t want to be smack-dab in the middle of the circle. Definitely be in the middle of the circle when there&rsquo;s less than ten people, but never outside of that. It&rsquo;ll give you peace of mind to be far away from the storm, but you&rsquo;re likely to get surrounded by multiple squads. Needing to fight two squads at the same time sucks. Needing to fight three squads at once is impossible. Don&rsquo;t put yourself in the middle of the circle and teams won&rsquo;t converge around you. When the next circle location is designated, move to it if you&rsquo;re not in a fight. Post up at the edge of the circle, ideally with cover on most sides. Squads will be fighting as the move toward the center. If your squad stays at the edge you&rsquo;re likely to only have enemies approaching from your rear or flanks. The enemies inside the circle with you will be moving toward the middle with their backs to you. Don&rsquo;t bother fighting them as they&rsquo;re going to be killing each other. Let them kill each other and try to approach the circle from the sides. Focus on getting to each successive circle. Once there&rsquo;s 10 people left, the real fun begins.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.u0w5r4n3dto9"><span class="c3">Sieging Castles</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Laying siege to a castle isn&rsquo;t fun. Seeing a looming structure with bullets emerging from its mouth and from doors and from windows is debilitating. You&rsquo;re never going to want to siege a castle unless it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary, and that&rsquo;s going to happen when your squad is close to closing out a victory. It&rsquo;s also only going to happen when your squad doesn&rsquo;t have building materials (or the time) to build its own castle. Or, it&rsquo;ll happen because you didn&rsquo;t get to the next circle in time to build a castle, so you&rsquo;re getting chased by the storm and have no choice but to siege the castle. You&rsquo;ll find yourself in these scenarios, but don&rsquo;t fret, there&rsquo;s a solution.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Step 1. The approach. You and your buddies are in the open and you&rsquo;re charging your way to the tower. Rockets are exploding and bullets are whizzing. How do you stop these things? Walls. Build walls as you approach. Wood walls are great because they&rsquo;ll get the job done for how temporary their service is. There&rsquo;s not much use firing up at the castle dwellers as you approach because they&rsquo;ve got great cover. You don&rsquo;t want to engage fire, you want to close the distance and get underneath them. Walls will get the job done. Any walls that are left over will help your squadmates approach as well. If you can help it, stagger your approach so that your buddy can approach from the same angle you did, but a few seconds afterward. Approaching from different angles will split their firepower but voids the use of any walls leftover. You might be tempted to build a stairway to heaven (quite literally) that&rsquo;ll close the distance while also getting you to the top of their castle, but these staircases are precarious. Shooting out the bottom is all it takes to ruin your approach. Don&rsquo;t bother with this approach unless you&rsquo;re convinced they won&rsquo;t notice (unlikely) your approach. Once your squad gets to the bottom of the castle, you&rsquo;re safe. (Mostly.) If the castle was built too high, there&rsquo;s no way they&rsquo;ll jump down to kill you. They also won&rsquo;t dare build a passage down to the bottom of the castle to get you. Their options are to ignore you, wait for you to build up to them, build awkwardly outward from their castle to get an angle at the base, or just throw explosives down at you, thereby risking the destruction of their own foundation. You&rsquo;re in the clear and it&rsquo;s your time to be offensive. Building scaffolding up to their tower from two different angles can allow your squad to get up to them and take control. If you&rsquo;ve got grenades and launchers, demolish the base of the tower and bring the whole thing down. The castle dwellers will take fall damage and can then be cleaned up by your squad. </span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c2"></span></p><h1 class="c1" id="h.7xm08nuze5s0"><span class="c3">Building a Castle</span></h1><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Don&rsquo;t build so high that you take fall damage if you jump off. That&rsquo;s a terrible idea. Never do that. Never extend your castle in order to edge your way into the circle. The next circle will laugh at you and go to opposite side or someone will shoot your floor out and you&rsquo;ll all die humiliating deaths. Don&rsquo;t build castles that are so wide that your squad can&rsquo;t quickly check the perimeter. A castle with too large a perimeter is a castle that gets scaffolding build up to it that no one notices until you&rsquo;ve got 4 guys jumping in on you with shoguns blaring. Don&rsquo;t build castles with tiny foundations. Build castles amidst other structures to give you a larger base to build on top off. This also gives you an inherit height boost as opposed to building on the grass. Build castles with brick. If you gotta span a gap, have your buds build pieces in parallel with yours so that no one demolished piece will bring the whole bridge down. Build strange features on the top of your castle to maximize angles and spots you can poke out from. A small top platform with only a few places to poke out from will get you sniped. Build windows or doors in your walls. Build ramps at each edge. And perhaps most importantly: don&rsquo;t forget that your castle won&rsquo;t win you the game. The circle gives and taketh away. Your castle is that which may be taken. Don&rsquo;t build a fortress. Ever. Build something defensible but meager. You&rsquo;ll need the resources for the next meager structure if the circle is unforgiving. Getting personally attached to a tower will get your killed. Being able to adapt and move and build as you go will get you the win. Don&rsquo;t forget that building high doesn&rsquo;t avoid rockets. Building high just gives you fall damage.</span>
